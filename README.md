# Pixeldust Front-end Assignment

> Shift booking application

Implement a shift booking application with and utilize the provided mock API.
See **[documentation](api/README.md)** for the API.

The application must implement the following views according the [design spec](./design-spec.pdf):

- **My shifts**
  - lists all booked shifts
  - shifts are grouped by dates
  - shifts can be cancelled
- **Available shifts**
  - filter shifts by the city
  - shifts are grouped by dates
  - shifts can be booked or cancelled

Relevant assets can be found in [`./assets`](./assets).

Considerations:

- you can choose to build the application in any front-end framework like React Js, Vue Js or any similar.
- we expect clean and robust state management
- we do not expect you to use a lot of time for the setup - you may use a starter repo
- the UI design is a reference and 1:1 implementation is not absolutely necessary
- creative skills can be used to improve the design
